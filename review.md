- No feedback when uploading the receipt.
- What does the "left"/"right" buttons do?
- Watch out for some specific react anti patterns, like componentDidUpdate that re-updates the state, or storing the same value in duplicated states (Menu vs ExpensesView)
- Renders and fetches all expenses at once. Make sure you only render a small amount of expenses and add more as you scroll. Adding so many expenses to the page can cause performance issues, scrolling won't be as smooth, more data is downloaded.
- See inline code comments for deeper feedback.
- Challenges for you:
-- Add an infinite scrolling list and only fetch data as needed 
-- Add feedback to actions related to async HTTP request, loading / spinner / anything
-- Write tests for your components
-- Use your own form componenents instead of the bootstrap ones
-- Try some more funky CSS and make it look badass
